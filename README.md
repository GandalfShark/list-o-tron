# list-o-tron
word list tool for CTFs
simple bash script to remove multiple words, extract single words from text docs, and merge multiple lists
syntax ./ListOTron <file.txt> <file2.txt> <file3.txt>
outputs as newlist.txt
you can input one file or up to 3
quite useful for CTFs that give you wordlists that have piles of repeating words
or for blending multiple word lists and pulling out only unique values
NOTE: do not name any of your files list1.txt or list2.txt as these are needed by the script to run
